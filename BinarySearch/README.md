Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is a fast search algorithm with runtime complexity of O(log n) .This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.

Binary Search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection.If match occurs, then the index of item is returned.
If the middle item is greater than item, the item is searched in the subarray to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for 
in the subarray to the right of the middle item. The process continues as well untill the size of the subarray reduces to zero.
